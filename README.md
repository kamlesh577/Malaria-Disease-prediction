Malaria remains a major burden on global health, with roughly 200 million cases worldwide and more than 400,000 deaths per year. Besides biomedical research and political efforts, modern information technology is playing a key role in many attempts at fighting the disease. 

Malaria is one of the major public health problems in India. Early prediction of a Malaria outbreak is the key for control of malaria morbidity, mortality as well as reducing the risk of transmission of malaria in the community and can help policymakers, health providers, medical officers, ministry of health and other health organizations to better target medical resources to areas of greatest need.

It is pretty clear that malaria is prevalent across the globe especially in tropical regions. The motivation for this project is however based on the nature and fatality of this disease. Initially if an infected mosquito bites you, parasites carried by the mosquito will get in your blood and start destroying oxygen-carrying RBCs (red blood cells). Typically the first symptoms of malaria are similar to the flu or a virus when you usually start feeling sick within a few days or weeks after the mosquito bite. However these deadly parasites can live in your body for over a year without any problems! Thus, a delay in the right treatment can lead to complications and even death. Hence early and effective testing and detection of malaria can save lives.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released several crucial facts on malaria which you can check out here. In short, nearly half the worldâ€™s population is at risk from malaria and there are over 200 million malaria cases and approximately 400,000 deaths due to malaria every year. This gives us all the more motivation to make malaria detection and diagnosis fast, easy and effective.
